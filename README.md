## Geungle Beat

This is the blog for [Geungle](http://geungle.com/), found at
[http://geungle.com/blog/](http://geungle.com/blog/).

### Contributing

The source for Geungle Beat is built using
[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/).

To get started, first install Ruby (my preference is to use
[RVM](https://rvm.io)) and [git](http://git-scm.com/). Then proceed as follows:

```
git clone http://github.com/pentandra/geunglebeat.git
cd geunglebeat
bundle
nanoc co
nanoc view
```
Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

### Thanks

Thanks to the people that helped me come to grips with the power of nanoc,
including:

* Vincent Driessen (https://github.com/nvie/blog)
* Dennis Defreyne, of course (https://github.com/ddfreyne/nanoc)
